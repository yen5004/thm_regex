# Task 5

Task 5Starts with/ ends with, groups, and either/ or

Sometimes it's very useful to specify that we want to search by a certain pattern **in the beginning or the end of a line**. We do that with these characters:

**`^`** - starts with

**`$`** - ends with

So for example, if you want to search for a line that **starts with** **`abc`**, you can use **`^abc`**.

If you want to search for a line that **ends with** **`xyz`**, you can use **`xyz$`**.

Note: The **`^`** hat symbol is used to exclude a charset when enclosed in **`[`**square brackets**`]`**, but when it is not, it is used to specify the beginning of a word.

You can also define groups by enclosing a pattern in **`(`**parentheses**`)`**. This function can be used for many ways that are not in the scope of this tutorial. We will use it to define an **either/ or** pattern, and also to repeat patterns. To say "or" in Regex, we use the **`|`** pipe.

For an "either/or" pattern example, the pattern **`during the (day|night)`** will match both of these sentences: **`during the day`** and **`during the night`**.

For a repetition example, the pattern **`(no){5}`** will match the sentence **`nonononono`**.
