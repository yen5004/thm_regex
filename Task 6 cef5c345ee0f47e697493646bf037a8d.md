# Task 6

TaskÂ 6 Conclusion

Well done.

Regular expressions are very powerful, even at their most basic usage. There are many resources to study and practice online, which I strongly recommend.

Also, if you plan on using regex to develop something and want to search for something like an e-mail, you should search for premade expressions instead of writing your own.

With regex, you have to think specifically, but not **too** specifically, because then you might come up with complicated solutions when there are other, more elegant, and simple ones.

Answer the questions below.
