# Task 3

Task 3Wildcards and optional characters

The wildcard that is used to match any single character (except the line break) is the **`.`** dot. That means that **`a.c`** will match **`aac`**, **`abc`**, **`a0c`**, **`a!c`**, and so on.

Also, you can set a character as optional in your pattern using the **`?`** question mark. That means that **`abc?`** will match **`ab`** and **`abc`**, since the **`c`** is optional.

Note: If you want to search for **`.`** a literal dot, you have to **escape it** with a **`\`** reverse slash. That means that **`a.c`** will match **`a.c`**, but also **`abc`**, **`a@c`**, and so on. But **`a\.c`** will match **just** **`a.c`**.
