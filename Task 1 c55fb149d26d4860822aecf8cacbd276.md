# Task 1

Task 1 Introduction

# **What are regular expressions?**

Regular expressions (or Regex) are patterns of text that you define to search documents and match exactly what you're looking for.

# **Why should I learn how to use them?**

Even if you won't need them sooner or later, it's a great tool to know how to use. It will make you more capable in CTF's, and potentially a better developer if that's a goal you have. You spend a little time learning it and save yourself lots of time in the long run by using it.

# **I know all that, but I'm lazy.**

This is a lazy person's tutorial. There's a little reading, and then you **learn by doing**.

# **Where's the 'Deploy' button?**

**There's no machine to deploy.** There are two ways to test your expressions. Either:

1. create a text file with some test paragraphs (in a Unix machine) and then use **`egrep <pattern> <file>`** to see what matches and what doesn't, or
2. use an online editor like [https://regexr.com/](https://regexr.com/). You can add your own text in the "Text" field, and then type your expressions (patterns) in the "Expression" field.

I recommend the second way.
