# Task 4

Task 4Metacharacters and repetitions

There are easier ways to match bigger charsets. For example, **`\d`** is used to match any **single** digit. Here's a reference:

**`\d`** matches a digit, like **`9`**

**`\D`** matches a non-digit, like **`A`** or **`@`**

**`\w`** matches an alphanumeric character, like **`a`** or **`3`**

**`\W`** matches a non-alphanumeric character, like **`!`** or **`#`**

**`\s`** matches a whitespace character (spaces, tabs, and line breaks)

**`\S`** matches everything else (alphanumeric characters and symbols)

Note: Underscores **`_`** are included in the **`\w`** metacharacter and not in **`\W`**. That means that **`\w`** will match every single character in **`test_file`**.

Often we want a pattern that matches many characters of a single type in a row, and we can do that with repetitions. For example, **`{2}`** is used to match the preceding character (or metacharacter, or charset) two times in a row. That means that **`z{2}`** will match exactly **`zz`**.

Here's a reference for each repetition along with how many times it matches the preceding pattern:

**`{12}`** - **exactly 12** times.

**`{1,5}`** - **1 to 5** times.

**`{2,}`** - **2 or more** times.

- **``** - **0 or more** times.

**`+`** - **1 or more** times.
